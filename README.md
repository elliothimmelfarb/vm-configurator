# VM Configurator
This branch is the result of running the command `npm run cleanup` which cleaned
all the example code while leaving the boilerplate structure intact.

Run `npm run dev` for development with hot reloading.

It is built on [this boilerplate](https://github.com/chentsulin/electron-react-boilerplate)
